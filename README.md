## Handmade Hero 2023/2024

Following along with Handmade Hero using the latest Windows SDK and modern C++.

## Building

To build the project on windows, you need the compiler installed, so you want to make sure you get the Microsoft Visual Studio Installer and then check off `Desktop Development with C++`

Then you want to add the path for `cl.exe` to your system path environment variables.

Mine was located at: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.35.32215\bin\Hostx64\x64\`

Then you can run `build.bat` to build the project, either by double clicking it, or by typing `build` into the command prompt.
